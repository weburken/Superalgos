        "text": "Superalgos is an incredible tool, alowing all kinds of traders to work together with an intuitive GUI. The app has a quite steep learning curve and seems at the beginning quite overwhelming but the tutorials are done in a way which guides you quickly through all the important features and one understands that the complexity which seems difficult to master in the beginning allows for an incredible flexibility without having to know a lot about programming.\n\nThe strongest feature of the app is however its community-driven apporach allowing users to alter the software and thereby to contribute to the project. Meaning that not only developpers can contribute but also experienced traders with little or no programming knowledge or also motivated newcomers as every little improvement counts.\n\nAs the software is an ever-increasing project I am looking forward to explore it more and to help to contribute.\n\nfredericopitz",
